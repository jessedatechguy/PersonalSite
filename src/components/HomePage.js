        I Recently graduated college. I like to play warzone I am ok at it. I
        also enjoy helping people people PCs. I built 2 pc for myself. I built
        one with the following{" "}

          specs
        </a>
        . I then resued these parts and built another pc with a mix. I use one
        for streaming when i play warzone or super smash and then I use the
        other to stream.

        I also enjoy riding my motorcycle. It is a very small bike but i enjoy
        working on it, cleaning it and just fixing it up. I am not a very good
        mechanic but I do work on it on my own. I am learning how to take care
        of it. I also want to start doing wheelies it is difficult I am too
        afraid of falling. I need to protect my bike with stunt bars and then I
        will start wheelies.
